## Earthquake Visualization

My task was to visualize an earthquake data set.

**Data set**

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I chose the JSON representation that provides data from 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days.'

**Import & Visualize the Data**

   I created a map using Leaflet.js that plots all of the earthquakes from this data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   The data markers reflect the size of the earthquake by magnitude and and depth of the earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

   I included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. The popups provide information about the earthquake's location and magnitude.

   I also created a legend that provides context for the map data.

   In my more advanced map, I added a map layer that represents the location of tectonic plates. I thought it would be interesting and helpful to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.

    Finally, I included layer controls to my visualization. I included layer controls for both base layer maps and overlay maps, which allow users to switch between these layers independently.
